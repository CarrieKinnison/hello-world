Being a good newbie and working through the exercise

Hi All,
Thanks for having me. I'm a retired engineer and have discovered the world of Ardruino, Wemos D1, and Android.
This stuff is crack. I mean the components are cheap! The community seems large and I can "make things go."
What fun! I hope to be contributing soon.
